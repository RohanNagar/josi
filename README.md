# Java OS Independence
Java OS Independence is a very simple and small library with the goal of making making decisions based on the current operating system at runtime easier.

## Getting Started

Maven:

```
```

Gradle:

```
```

### Examples

## Contributing
Here are the things you can do:

 - Add a new operating system for the OS enum. I sadly can't test and add every operating system there is myself, so I have to rely on the community to grow this aspect further.
 - Add a new utility method to the OS enum, but only if you are convinced that it can be useful in many circumstances, as we do not not want to bloat the libray.
 - Test the code on your machine, i.e. check if it actually returns the correct operating system for you.
 - Make suggestions, i.e. if you want to contribute larger changes to the project, create a pull requets or issue (beforehand) and if it fits, we'll implement it!
